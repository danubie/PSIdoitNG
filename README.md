# PSIdoitNG
Next generation of a Powershell interface for I-doit-API (by Synetics)
## Why a new module?
The modules found at day of writing did not work with our release if i-doit API.
The projects found where stale for years and had some initial problems (espacially when using PS7).
## Goals
- Nothing without Pester tests
- Simple API trace option (to gather Pester input from it)
- Minimum setup on functions to connect and read objects
- Hopefully have time enough for more
## Thanks!
